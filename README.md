# AppleScript-sort-the-same-file-from-the-sub-folder

This script is designed to get the input and output file of the test data of [Contest Hunter](https://www.contesthunter.org).

Run the script and it will move all the input and output file in the sub folders to the script's path 
and rename them with "input#case.in" and "output#case.out".
(#case will be replace by 1,2,3...)

The sub folders will be delete automatic.
